<br/>

## Xray at CI/CD
- One of the Package Manager Integration we can use

#### MAVEN - Package Manager Integration

- `cd JFTD104-Intro_to_DevSecOps_with_JFrog_Xray/lab-3/project-examples/maven-vulnerable-example`
- To pre-configured with the Artifactory server, repositories and use for building and publishing. The configuration is stored by the command in the .jfrog directory at the root directory of the project.)
  - Run ``jf mvnc``
    - Resolve dependencies from Artifactory? (y/n) [y]? `y`
    - Set Artifactory server ID [swampup2023]: â†µ
    - Set resolution repository for release dependencies (press Tab for options): `jftd104-libs-release-virtual`
    - Set resolution repository for snapshot dependencies (press Tab for options): `jftd104-libs-snapshot-virtual`
    - Deploy project artifacts to Artifactory? (y/n) [y]? `y`
    - Set Artifactory server ID [swampup2023]: â†µ
    - Set repository for release artifacts deployment (press Tab for options): `jftd104-libs-release-virtual`
    - Set repository for snapshot artifacts deployment (press Tab for options): `jftd104-libs-snapshot-virtual`
    - Would you like to filter out some of the deployed artifacts? (y/n) [n]? `n`
- Run ``jf mvn clean install -f ./pom.xml -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Dartifactory.publish.artifacts=true --build-name swampup23_jftd104_mvn_pipeline --build-number 1.0.0``

NOTE : We can also ``jf mvnc`` without interactive interface 
  ```
  jf mvnc --repo-resolve-snapshots jftd104-libs-snapshot-virtual --repo-resolve-releases jftd104-libs-release-virtual --repo-deploy-snapshots jftd104-libs-snapshot-virtual --repo-deploy-releases jftd104-libs-release-virtual
  ```

- Run ``jf npm publish --build-name swampup23_jftd104_npm_pipeline --build-number 1.0.0`` - Publish build Artifact to repository

NOTE : We can also ``jf npmc`` without interactive interface
  ```
  jf npmc --repo-resolve jftd104-npm-virtual --repo-deploy jftd104-npm-virtual 
  ```

### SCAN BUILD
- Scan a published build-info with Xray using **jf build-scan**
  ```
  jf bs swampup23_jftd104_mvn_pipeline 1.0.0
  ```
  or
  ```
  jf bs swampup23_jftd104_npm_pipeline 1.0.0

- Additional commands, `--vuln`, `--fail`, `--format`, [more](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Xray#CLIforJFrogXray-ScanningPublishedBuilds)
- Xray should fail the build with the following raised security violations
  
  | SEVERITY | IMPACTED PACKAGE | IMPACTED PACKAGE VERSION | TYPE  | FIXED VERSIONS | COMPONENT | COMPONENT VERSION | CVE |
  | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----- | -------------- | --------  | ----------------- | -------- |

- See violations in the Artifactory UI. Navigate to **Application** > **Security & Compliance** > **Watch Violations**. You will be able to see the watches that we have created in Step 1. Click on the `prod-watch`. The Violations tab in a Watch is the central location for viewing the detected violations based on the policies and rules you have predefined on the Watch. You can view the list of the violations, search for violations according to filters, set ignore rules and edit the Watch in the Settings tab.

- **Ignore Violation** by navigating to **Application** > **Security & Compliance** > **Watch Violation**. Open watch `prod-watch` that we created in STEP 1 and hover your mouse over the right side of a violation.

### RESCAN BUILD AFTER UPDATE VERSION OF VULNERABLE DEPENDENCIES 

- Follow the same sequence of steps as above to run a successful build this time.

- This time the build should succeed with the following message
