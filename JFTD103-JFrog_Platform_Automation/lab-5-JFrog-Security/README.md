# Shift Left 
## IDE PLUGIN
- The cost of remediating a vulnerability is akin to the cost of fixing a bug. The earlier you remediate a vulnerability in the release cycle, the lower the cost.
- The IDE integration completes the CI/CD process, by bringing Xray's issue discovery one step earlier, to development time.

<br/>

### SETUP IDE PLUGIN
- Open one of the above IDE and install plugin/extension called `JFrog`.
- Configure plugin against the JFrog Platform by providing `JFrog Platform URL`, `Username`, `Password` or `Access Token`
- Open either `npm-example` or `maven-example` project from `example` 
  - Run `npm install` or `mvn clean install` (NOTE: make sure your native client is pointing to Artifactory instance to download dependencies)
- Open `JFrog` tab and review list of vulnerabilities 

<br/>
<br/>

## DEPENDENCIES SCAN
- With this feature, before a developer even checks-in the code they can scan using JFrog CLI for security or license violations saving valuable time to address these issues.
- Navigate to either `npm-example` or `maven-example` project from `example`
- Run `jf npmc` or `jf mvnc`
- Run `jf audit` or `jf aud` (NOTE: we can also pass additional command like `--dep-type`, `--watches`, `--project`, `--repo-path`, etc)
    - Supported package types: Maven, Gradle, npm, Pip, Pipenv, Go, Nuget, .NET core CLI, Yarn2
- Run the scan command with the relevant command options. You can view scan results for the following:
    - Vulnerabilities, Violations, License
- List output into table format as DEFAULT `--format=json|table`
- More Information on [Dependencies Scan](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-cli/scanning-project-dependencies)

<br/>
<br/>

## ON-DEMAND BINARY SCAN
- Xray uses the JFrog CLI to provide **on-demand binary scanning** to address:
    - Run ad-hoc scans for security purposes **without uploading to Artficatory first**.
    - Adhere to organizational standards, whereas binaries and builds need to be **approved** first before uploading to Artifactory.
    - Not all binaries are stored in Artifactory, and as a user, you want to use Xray scanning capabilities.
- Navigate to either `npm-example` or `maven-example` project from `example`
- Run `jf scan` or `jf s`
    - sample (maven or npm) files are located under `JFTD103-JFrog_Platform_Automation/lab-4-AQL/sample-data/`
- For Docker, Run `jf docker scan` (NOTE: we can also pass additional command like `--watches`, `--project`, `--repo-path`, etc)
- For scan binary locally, Run `jf s "path/to/files/"` (NOTE: we can also pass additional command like `--watches`, `--project`, `--repo-path`, etc)
- More Information on [on-demand binary scan](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-cli/on-demand-binary-scan)

<br/>
<br/>

## DOCKER DESKTOP EXTENSION [Optional]
- Download Docker Desktop application
- Install [JFrog Extension](https://hub.docker.com/extensions/jfrog/jfrog-docker-desktop-extension)
- Configure Extension pointing to your JFrog Platform instance
- Now we can scan any of the docker image that we have locally and see Xray scan results
- More Information on [Docker Desktop Extension for JFrog Xray](https://jfrog.com/solution-sheet/docker-desktop-extension-for-jfrog-xray/)

<br/>
<br/>

# JFROG ADVANCED SECURITY
## Vulnerability Contextual Analysis
- JFrog Security and the JFrog research team's continuous effort to enhance security is introducing an additional capability: [Vulnerability Contextual Analysis](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-security-documentation/vulnerability-contextual-analysis). JFrog Xray previously released a powerful capability, the [JFrog Security CVE Research and Enrichment](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-security-documentation/jfrog-security-cve-research-and-enrichment) feature, that helps you with enhanced analysis on CVE findings in a way that allows you to focus on the most important issues with the capability of finding the best resources invested in fixing them. Vulnerability Contextual Analysis is an extension to that capability, ensuring Xray's analysis findings are as focused as possible.
- Review in IDE and in UI under [Scan List](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-security-documentation/xray-scans-list)
- Vulnerability Contextual Analysis Statuses 
  - Not applicable: The vulnerability is not applicable 
  - Applicable: The vulnerability is applicable 
  - Undetermined - not triggered: An admin needs to enable this feature. 
  - Undetermined – analysis in progress: If Xray is in the process of analyzing the vulnerability applicability, it is indicated in the vulnerability details as analysis in progress. 
  - Undetermined - inconclusive: Xray was unable to determine if the vulnerability is applicable or not. 
  - Undetermined - no scanner: An applicability scanner for this vulnerability is not available.

<br/>

## Secrets Detection
- Detects any secret left exposed in the artifacts stored in Artifactory to stop any accidental leak of internal tokens, credentials, or use of expired certificates.

<br/>

## Application Libraries Misuse
- Detects whether common OSS libraries and services are used securely by the application.
- Examples 
  - Insecure use of credentials (insecure key storage)
  - Enforcement of secure communication (redirecting HTTP to HTTPS, enforcing TLS, verifying the TLS certificates of all servers in Python scripts, enforcing TLS version, using secure HTTP headers)
  - Use of weak crypto keys 
  - Throttle logins to prevent brute-force attacks (Throttle Node.js logins to prevent brute-force attacks)
  - Invoking Node.js exec functionality with user-provided input

<br/>

## Services Configuration Security
- Detects whether common OSS libraries and services are configured securely, so an application can be easily hardened by default.
- Examples
  - Insecure use of credentials (NGINX credential in config file, credential stored insecurely)
  - Enforcement of secure communication (redirecting HTTP to HTTPS, enforcing TLS, TLS version)
  - Allowing weak crypto algorithms 
  - Externally exposing Admin interface 
  - Un-authenticated access to resources

<br/>

## IaC Security Analysis
- Scans IaC files stored in Artifactory for early detection of cloud and infrastructure misconfigurations to prevent attacks and data leak.
- Examples
  - Insufficient access restrictions to services (public access to repositories, publicly accessible clusters, globally readable/deletable/writeable buckets, use of admin roles in ECS services, IAM users with privileged access to all resources, enforce authorization for all API Gateway methods)
  - Insecure use of credentials (use of hardcoded credentials)
  - Allowing weak crypto algorithms (use of weak cipher suites)
  - Running batches in privileged mode 
  - Enforcement of secure communication (listening to HTTP, unencrypted communications)
  - Wildcard actions in Glue policies 
  - Missing logging (e.g., found CloudTrail trails with logging disabled)
  - Disabled upgrades (e.g., RDS database instance with disabled minor engine upgrades)
  - Data at rest encryption enablement for Kinesis streams

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# CURATION
- JFrog [Curation](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-curation/jfrog-curation-overview) addresses the threat of software supply chain attacks by enabling organizations to ensure packages are vetted before they are included in their software.
- These rules prevent packages with potential security or licensing problems from being downloaded from a public repository to your remote repository.
- [JFrog CLI for Curation](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-curation/jfrog-curation-overview)
  - ``jf curation-audit``
- First let go to ``Platform Configuration`` in UI.
- Navigate to Curation in left NavBar
- Click on `Curated Repositories` and flip the toggle
- Lets create Curation Policy and `GPL Block`
  - `Repositories` -> All Curated
  - `Policy Condition` -> Package license GNU GPL
  - `Waivers` -> Next
  - `Actions & Notifications` -> Block
- Now lets go to `JFTD103-JFrog_Platform_Automation/lab-5-JFrog-Security/example/npm-example`
  - RUN `npm install extjs-gpl@6.2.0`

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# SCAN BUILD
- Scan a published build-info with Xray using **jf build-scan**
  ```
  jf bs payment-maven $BUILD_NUMBER
  ```
  or
  ```
  jf bs auth-npm $BUILD_NUMBER
  ```
- Additional commands, `--vuln`, `--fail`, `--format`, [more](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-cli/scanning-published-builds)
- Xray should fail the build with the following raised security violations

  | SEVERITY | IMPACTED PACKAGE | IMPACTED PACKAGE VERSION | TYPE  | FIXED VERSIONS | COMPONENT | COMPONENT VERSION | CVE |
    | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----- | -------------- | --------  | ----------------- | -------- |
  | 🔥High   | org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core | 2.14.1 | Maven | [2.12.2] [2.15.0] [2.3.1] | org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core | 2.14.1  | CVE-2021-44228 |
  | 🎃Medium | org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core | 2.14.1 | Maven | [2.12.2] [2.16.0] [2.3.1] | org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core | 2.14.1  | CVE-2021-45046 |
